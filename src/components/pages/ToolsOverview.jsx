      question: "Can I trade forex without a broker?",
      answer:
        "You can by exchanging currencies at a bank or local currency exchange (at the airport for example).

Trading forex with an online broker like RightTrade Capital also offers other benefits including customer support, rapid execution and educational resources to help you on your way.",

For information, check out our handy guide to choosing the best trading account.",

      question: "Can I trade forex without a broker?",

The downside of this is you won't have access to leverage or risk management tools like Stop Loss and Take Profit. Trading forex with an online broker like RightTrade Capital also offers other benefits including customer support, rapid execution and educational resources to help you on your way.",
